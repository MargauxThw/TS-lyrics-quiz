# Taylor Swift Lyrics Quiz
A [lyrics quiz site](https://ts-lyrics-quiz.netlify.app/) built based off the code base from my previous [lyrics searcher](https://github.com/MargauxThw/TS-lyrics-searcher). Players can select from a list of quiz types (by album or song section e.g. Choruses) and then have to guess the line based on the lines before and after. Scores are calculated by similarity and then shown in an interactive summary graph at the end.
